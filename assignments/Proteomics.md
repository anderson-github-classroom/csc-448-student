I am providing the autograder answers locally so you may test your code before pushing. I will be reviewing your submissions, and if I find you are circumventing the autograder in any manner, you will receive a 0 on this assignment and your case will be reported to the honor board for review. i.e., approach the assignment in a genuine manner and you have nothing to worry about.
