    "I first set out to get everyone contributing to a Latex document hosted on Overleaf. After spending a lot of (what would later become unnecessary) time coming up with an introduction to Latex, I realized the fatal flaw. I cannot easily figure out who made what contribution and thus grade your weekly effort. While not perfect for other presentation related reasons, I have settled on a Google Doc. Given our short week, here is your project assignment for the weekend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Examine the Google doc and take a look at the questions I've identified in the document.\n",
    "2. Take a look at the analyses of your classmates and those highlighted here: https://anderson-github-classroom.github.io/csc-448-project/wiobrien/, https://anderson-github-classroom.github.io/csc-448-project/mhowland/\n",
    "3. Contribute to the Google doc. Let's knock this into shape as a team\n",
    "    a. Formatting\n",
    "    b. Edits\n",
    "    c. Intro and lit review\n",
    "    d. Help importing figures\n",
    "    e. Moving your analysis and figures over\n",

    "    \n",
    "IMPORTANT - Do not stress about making this document perfect before Monday. Honestly, let's make it a bit of a mess with contributions. Then we can start to sort things out. I mean... don't make things a mess on purpose, but don't stress about making what you contribute perfect. Just contribute something."
