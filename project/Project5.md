## Project Part 5(a.k.a. Project 5 on Schedule)
I first set out to get everyone contributing to a Latex document hosted on Overleaf. After spending a lot of (what would later become unnecessary) time coming up with an introduction to Latex, I realized the fatal flaw. I cannot easily figure out who made what contribution and thus grade your weekly effort. While not perfect for other presentation related reasons, I have settled on a Google Doc. I am going to share the following link to each of your Cal Poly emails. Given our short week, here is your project assignment for the weekend:

1. Examine the Google doc and take a look at the questions I've identified in the document.
2. Take a look at the analyses of your classmates and those highlighted here: https://anderson-github-classroom.github.io/csc-448-project/wiobrien/, https://anderson-github-classroom.github.io/csc-448-project/mhowland/
3. Contribute to the Google doc. Let's knock this into shape as a team
    a. Formatting
    b. Edits
    c. Intro and lit review
    d. Help importing figures
    e. Moving your analysis and figures over
    
IMPORTANT - Do not stress about making this document perfect before Monday. Honestly, let's make it a bit of a mess with contributions. Then we can start to sort things out. I mean... don't make things a mess on purpose, but don't stress about making what you contribute perfect. Just contribute something.
