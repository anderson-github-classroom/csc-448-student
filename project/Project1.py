# ## Project Part 1 (a.k.a. Project 1 on Schedule)
# We don't know enough bioinformatics yet, but we can start the project by cleaning up and improving your individual websites. For Project 1, I want you to read and summarize/synthesize/discuss the following links on your own pages within the main project repo. This is definitely less of a "for grade" assignment. There is a pandemic, and I believe we can contribute meaningful bioinformatics analysis. That starts with a review of currently available resources. Please use my links as a starting point, but post more links on Slack for others. Find more links. Together we can make a contribution. Here are the links that you should investigate at a minimum.
